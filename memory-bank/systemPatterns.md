# System Patterns

- **Architecture Overview:** React PWA application using Vite, React Router, TailwindCSS. (Shadcn/UI initialized but components seem missing/unused).
- **Key Components:** `App` (Routing, Keyboard Nav [Arrows, 'f', 'Esc'], Fullscreen), `HomePage` (Renders root `/`, **implements sticky header, consistent button placement**, provides textarea for slide editing, saves to local storage, includes Reset button), `SlidesViewer` (Renders Carousel for `/slide/:slideNumber`), `Carousel` (Handles sliding animation), `SlidePage` (Renders single slide markdown), `useSlides` (Hook for parsing markdown from localStorage/`slides.md`).
- **Data Flow:** `localStorage['quickslides-content']` or `slides.md?raw` -> `useSlides` -> `App`/`SlidesViewer` -> `Carousel` -> `SlidePage`. User edits/resets in `HomePage` -> `localStorage['quickslides-content']`.
- **State Management:** Slide content managed via local storage (`quickslides-content`) and React state (`HomePage`, `useSlides`). Current slide index primarily managed via URL parameters (`/slide/:slideNumber`). Fullscreen state managed via browser API.
- **Design Patterns:** Container/Presentational (App/SlidesViewer manage state, Carousel/SlidePage display), Hooks (`useSlides`), **Sticky Header (for persistent navigation/actions in `HomePage`)**, Responsive Visibility (using Tailwind classes like `sm:hidden` to adapt layout).
- **API Design:** n/a (Uses browser localStorage API).
- **Important Decisions:** URL-based state management for slides index. Local storage for slide content persistence. CSS transform/transition for slide animation. Standard HTML elements used for UI on HomePage due to missing Shadcn components. Keyboard shortcuts (Arrows, 'f', 'Esc') implemented in `App.tsx`. Homepage includes Reset functionality. Path aliasing configured to use "@/" pattern for imports from the src directory to improve code readability and maintainability. **Sticky header implemented in `HomePage` for consistent access to title and Present button.**
