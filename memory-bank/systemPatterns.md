# System Patterns

*   **Architecture Overview:** React PWA application
*   **Key Components:** slide rendering, change slide animation, current slide state, full-screen state
*   **Data Flow:** the slides should be stored in a "slides.md" document, the current slide and full-screen state should be persisted in the url
*   **Design Patterns:** separate Containers, Hooks and Dumb Components
*   **API Design:** no api
*   **Important Decisions:** url-based state management
