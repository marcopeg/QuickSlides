# Progress

*   **What Works:** Basic Vite project structure (React/TS), React Router installed, TailwindCSS installed and configured, Shadcn/UI initialized (but components seem missing), Example `slides.md` created in `src/`, `useSlides` hook modified for data parsing (reads from localStorage first, then `slides.md`), Basic slide routing (`/slide/:id`) implemented, Invalid slide number redirects to `/slide/1`, Basic Markdown rendering in slides (`SlidePage`), Basic slide container styling, Keyboard navigation (ArrowLeft/Right, 'Esc' to Home) implemented in `App.tsx`, Fullscreen toggle ('f' key) implemented in `App.tsx`, Sliding transition animation implemented via `Carousel` component, New `HomePage` (`/`) with textarea for editing slides and saving to local storage.
*   **What Needs Building/Fixing:** Implement specific image rendering logic (full-slide vs inline).
*   **Current Status:** Basic slide viewing, keyboard navigation (including Esc to Home), fullscreen toggle, and animated transitions functional. Homepage allows editing slide content via textarea, saved to local storage. Slide viewer now uses local storage content if available.
*   **Known Issues/Risks:** Placeholder images used in `slides.md`. Specific image rendering rules not implemented yet. Path alias (`@/`) resolution issues persist; using relative paths. Shadcn UI components (`Button`, `Textarea`) missing/not found; standard HTML elements used as replacement on `HomePage`.
