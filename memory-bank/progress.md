# Progress

*   **What Works:** Basic Vite project structure (React/TS), React Router installed, TailwindCSS installed and configured, Shadcn/UI initialized (but components seem missing), Example `slides.md` created in `src/`, `useSlides` hook modified for data parsing (reads from localStorage first, then `slides.md`), Basic slide routing (`/slide/:id`) implemented, Invalid slide number redirects to `/slide/1`, Basic Markdown rendering in slides (`SlidePage`), Basic slide container styling, Keyboard navigation (ArrowLeft/Right, 'Esc' to Home) implemented in `App.tsx`, Fullscreen toggle ('f' key) implemented in `App.tsx`, Sliding transition animation implemented via `Carousel` component, Refined `HomePage` (`/`) layout (textarea spacing, font, button focus rings) with editing/saving/resetting features.
*   **What Needs Building/Fixing:** Implement specific image rendering logic (full-slide vs inline).
*   **Current Status:** Basic slide viewing, keyboard navigation (including Esc to Home), fullscreen toggle, and animated transitions functional. Homepage layout refined, allows editing/saving/resetting/presenting. Slide viewer uses local storage content if available.
*   **Known Issues/Risks:** Placeholder images used in `slides.md`. Specific image rendering rules not implemented yet. Path alias (`@/`) resolution issues persist. Missing Shadcn components. Button visibility in dark mode might need further investigation (Tailwind config?).
