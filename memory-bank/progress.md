# Progress

*   **What Works:** Basic Vite project structure (React/TS), React Router installed, TailwindCSS installed and configured, Shadcn/UI initialized, Example `slides.md` created in `src/`, `useSlides` hook created for data parsing.
*   **What Needs Building/Fixing:** Setup slide routing (`/` and `/slide/:id`), Implement slide navigation (keys, animation, full-screen), Implement slide rendering (markdown, image handling).
*   **Current Status:** Slide data is available via the `useSlides` hook. Ready to implement routing and rendering.
*   **Known Issues/Risks:** Placeholder images used in `slides.md`. Markdown rendering not implemented.
