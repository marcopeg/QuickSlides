# Progress

*   **What Works:** Basic Vite project structure (React/TS), React Router installed, TailwindCSS installed and configured, Shadcn/UI initialized, Example `slides.md` created in `src/`, `useSlides` hook created for data parsing, Basic slide routing (`/` -> `/slide/1`, `/slide/:id`) implemented with `SlidePage` component, Invalid slide number redirects to `/slide/1`, Basic Markdown rendering in slides using `react-markdown`, Basic slide container styling, All core Data tasks (creation, parsing, routing) complete, Keyboard navigation (ArrowLeft/Right) implemented in `App.tsx`.
*   **What Needs Building/Fixing:** Implement slide navigation (animation, full-screen key), Specific image rendering logic (full-slide vs inline).
*   **Current Status:** Basic slide viewing and keyboard navigation functional.
*   **Known Issues/Risks:** Placeholder images used in `slides.md`. Specific image rendering rules not implemented yet. No slide transition animations. Path alias (`@/`) resolution issues encountered (using relative paths as workaround).
