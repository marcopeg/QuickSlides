# Active Context

- **Current Focus:** Implement specific image rendering logic (full-slide vs inline).
- **Recent Changes:** Refined `HomePage` layout for better usability across devices. Implemented a sticky header containing the title and 'Present' button. The 'Present' button is now consistently in the header on all screen sizes. This follows the implementation of a VSCode-inspired dark theme.
- **Next Steps:** Implement specific image rendering logic in `SlidePage.tsx` or a custom markdown component.
- **Open Questions/Decisions:** How to handle image rendering rules?
- **Blockers:** Missing Shadcn components (need verification if still an issue).
