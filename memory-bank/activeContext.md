# Active Context

*   **Current Focus:** Implement remaining navigation features (Fullscreen key 'f').
*   **Recent Changes:** Implemented keyboard arrow navigation (left/right) in App.tsx. Documented path alias issues and workarounds (relative paths) in progress.md.
*   **Next Steps:** Implement 'f' key listener for fullscreen toggle. Address specific image rendering rules.
*   **Open Questions/Decisions:** How to implement fullscreen (Browser API)? How to handle image rendering rules?
*   **Blockers:** Path alias issue might need further investigation later if relative paths become cumbersome.
