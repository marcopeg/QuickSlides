# QuickSlides

Minimalistic SlideDeck utility that was build in **Vibe Coding**.

## Quick Start

```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Vibe Coding

Yes, I've built this App from scratch in nearly pure _Vibe Coding_.

Almost every feature was built by Cursor our of simple - and often poorly written - english prompts.

ðŸ˜‡ Now that I think of it, this README is the longest content that I've written for this project. And I'm actually writing it using superwhisper, so I'm mostly dictating this to an AI.

> ðŸ¤¨ The only part that I really struggled to get done with Cursor was a good installation and initialization of TailwindCSS and ShadCN. That part was messed up and I got all kinds of troubles with spacing and other things.
>
> Eventually, I removed everything and followed a tutorial to just add the import Tailwind in the main CSS and that did the trick.

## Warning: Can be addictive!

So, I'm working on this app since a few hours. I've spend around 150 Cursor tokens (~6â‚¬)
and I've added more features than I initially planned.

I've definitely reached the "good enough" level.

After all, this is just a demo project for a presentation about Vibe Coding.

BUT.

I CAN'T STOP.

PLEASE HELP ME STOP.
