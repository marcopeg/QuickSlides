# QuickSlides

for moments that really matter

Your slides, as [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) annotations

# Full-Screen Images

If you put one single image in a slide,  
it will render as a cover for such slide:

---

![Millennium Falcon](/images/millennium-falcon.png)

# Inline Images

as you would do in any other content:

# Mixed Images

Try to put only 2 images in the slide to get  
a cool **split effect**:

![Lightsabers](/images/light-saber.png)
