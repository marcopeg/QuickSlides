# 🎇 Full-Screen Images

If you put one single image in a slide,  
it will render as a cover for such slide:

---

![Millennium Falcon](/images/millennium-falcon.png)

---

# Inline Images

Otherwise, just put your images in the Markdown  
as you would do in any other content:

Use the Force!

---

# Mixed Images

Try to put only 2 images in the slide to get  
a cool **split effect**:

---

![Millennium Falcon](/images/millennium-falcon.png)
![Lightsabers](/images/xwing.jpg)

# Embed HTML
